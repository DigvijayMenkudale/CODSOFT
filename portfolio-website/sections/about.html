  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Digvijay — currently pursuing my MCA at MIT Vishwaprayag University, Solapur. I'm an aspiring full-stack developer with a strong passion for coding, problem-solving, and building real-world web applications.<br><br>
    I enjoy working across the full development stack using technologies like React, Node.js, and Firebase. I’m also exploring cloud platforms like AWS and the exciting possibilities of AI in web development.<br><br>
    As a fast learner and dedicated team player, I’m always eager to grow, take on new challenges, and contribute meaningfully to impactful tech projects.
